        <h1>Possible Images For My Portfolio</h1>
    <br>
            <h2>Image 1</h2>
                <p>I chose this first image because I am currently working in digital marketing for the UMass Press, and this image could be used on a page dedicated to showing my work with the press. </p>

            <h2>Image 2</h2>
                <p>I added this image because of my minor in Latin. I feel that this could be used on a page with some of my skills that don't have a defined category.</p>

            <h2>Image 3</h2>
                <p>While this image is a bit strange, I thought it would be a fun, interesting way to show my love for writing, or introduce a page of my published pieces.</p>

            <h2>Image 4</h2>
                <p>Quite honestly, I have no clue how this image directly relates to me, but I really like it. I feel that it could make a good filler image.</p>
