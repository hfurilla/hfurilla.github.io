        <h1> About Hailey Furilla</h1>

        <p>Hi! My name is Hailey Furilla, and I’m currently a student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst). Currently, I’m working with the University of Massachusetts Press (UMass Press)  in order to promote their newest novels and extend our reach to more book lovers. As an English major with specialization in Professional Writing and Technical Communication as well as Creative Writing, I am interested in all aspects of writing and hope to share this appreciation with others. </p>
        <p>In the future, I seek to apply this passion for writing to the publishing industry. While working with the UMass Press allows me to develop my promotional skills within digital marketing, I’ve also taken other roles in order to advance my own writing and expose myself to a variety of writing styles. Namely, I’ve been writing as a columnist for UMass Amherst’s newspaper, the Daily Collegian, while also working with a team of editors on poetry pieces for the literary magazine Jabberwocky. </p>
        <p>I am eager to keep developing my skill as a writer, editor, and marketer, but most of all, I am always looking for more ways to create a larger community of readers and writers. If you ever want to talk more about writing, you can reach me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/hailey-furilla-560577290/?trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile_pic"> LinkedIn</a>, or you can shoot me an <a href="mailto:hfurilla@umass.edu">email</a>!</p>
