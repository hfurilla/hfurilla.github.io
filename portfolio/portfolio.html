                    <p>Under the Professional Writing and Technical Communication certificate (PWTC) at the Univeristy of Massachusetts Amherst, I was given the opportunity to formate one of my own poems using Adobe InDesign. Over the course of a semester, I learned how to utilize the various tools and setting of InDesign to import text and images to make creative yet practical layouts. Click below to see my final project, where I formatted a chapbook for my long poem "Drift."</p>
